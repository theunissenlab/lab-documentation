# Things to do to get set up in the lab

1. Get access to the [lab github](https://github.com/theunissenlab). Should just need to be added by a current member.

2. Request [key card access to LKS](http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/LKSC-Access-Request-Form.pdf). (Anyone remember exactly what rooms to request?)

3. Get a user account on the lab network (currently only Frederic knows how to do this?), and set up VPN access

4. [Get access to animal facility in NAF](https://www.olac.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/forms/general_access_form.pdf)

5. Setting up software... python/matlab?
